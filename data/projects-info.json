      "description": "This initiative develops advanced predictive models that integrate data from electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging, and wearable sensors to provide personalized treatment recommendations for individual patients. In parallel, it aims to optimize resource allocation and intervention strategies at the community and healthcare system levels. The methodological framework combines causal inference for understanding treatment effects, federated learning for privacy-preserving model training across institutions, and uncertainty-aware decision support systems to enhance the reliability and interpretability of clinical recommendations. Ultimately, this approach seeks to bridge precision medicine with public health optimization, ensuring that both individual and collective healthcare outcomes are improved.",

      "description": "We develop multi-scale mathematical and computational models that integrate tumor growth dynamics, immune system interactions, and therapeutic intervention schedules. At the cellular and tissue levels, agent-based models (ABMs) capture spatial heterogeneity, stochastic behavior of individual cells, and local immune–tumor interactions. At the population or organ scale, continuum models—typically formulated as systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) or ordinary differential equations (ODEs)—describe macroscopic tumor expansion, immune infiltration, and drug diffusion. These scales are dynamically coupled to account for feedback between molecular, cellular, and systemic processes. Numerical solvers are implemented to simulate the coupled PDE–ODE systems, while agent-based simulations provide fine-grained insights into cellular mechanisms. Together, these computational frameworks enable optimization of treatment regimens, exploration of therapeutic synergies, and hypothesis testing for personalized and adaptive cancer therapies.",
